This repo contains my solutions to the CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python course programming exercises for week 0

# 1. Indoor Voice Problem:
In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# 2. Playback Speed Problem:
In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
